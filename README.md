# Programming

Repository which contains noob level guide to programming. :brain:

This guide is pretty tl;dr and assumes you can Google stuff as needed.

## Preparation

Install these first.

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Code examples are executed via a _terminal_, so have one ready.
